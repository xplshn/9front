.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ext4srv
is a file server that interprets the Linux Second, Third and Fourth
Extended File Systems.
A single instance of
.I ext4srv
can provide access to multiple ext2, ext3 and ext4 partitions
simultaneously.
.PP
.I Ext4srv
posts a file descriptor named
.I srvname
(default
.BR ext4 )
in the
.B /srv
directory.  To access an ext4 file system on a device, use
.B mount
with the
.I spec
argument
(see
.IR bind (1))
the name of the file holding the raw ext4 file system, typically the
disk or partition.
If
.I spec
is undefined in the
.BR mount ,
.I ext4srv
will use
.I file
as the default name for the device holding the file system.
.PP
Normally
.I ext4srv
creates a pipe to act as the communications channel between itself and
its clients.
The
.B -s
flag instructs
.I ext4srv
to use its standard input and output instead.  This flag also prevents
the creation of an explicit service file in
.BR /srv .
.PP
By default,
.I ext4srv
will try to parse and use
.I /etc/group
file for permission checks, if available on the mounted filesystem.
The optional
.B -g
flag specifies Unix-format group file that gives the mapping between
the numeric user- and group-ID numbers in the Extended file system and
the strings reported by Plan 9 status inquiries.  The file is assumed
to reside on the filesystem where
.I ext4srv
executable is running, not the one to be mounted.
.PP
With
.B -S
option the filesystem can be mounted in "root" mode, allowing full
access, regardless of permissions.
.PP
With
.B -r
option the filesystem will be reamed - the old data erased and the
file reformatted as specified.  An optional label can be specified
with
.BR -L ,
block size (default is 4096 bytes) with
.B -b
and
inode size (default is 256 bytes) with
.BR -I .
