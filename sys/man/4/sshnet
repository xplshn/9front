.SH DESCRIPTION
The SSH protocol allows clients to make outgoing and incoming TCP calls
via the server.
.I Sshnet
establishes an SSH connection and, rather than execute a remote command,
presents the remote server's TCP stack as a network stack
(see the discussion of TCP in
.IR ip (3))
mounted before
.I mtpt
(default
.BR /net ),
optionally posting a 9P service
descriptor for the new file system as
.IB /srv/ service \fR.
All other arguments are passed to
.IR ssh (1)
as is.
.PP
For
.IR dial (2)
operations, name resolution happens on the remote side as
.I sshnet
serves a
.IR mtpt /cs
file that passes the hostname to the
.B connect
dial string.
Other query operations are passed verbatim to the
original connection service at
.IR mtpt /cs.
