# lola

Lola is the attempt at a new window system. Its architecture is based
on that of rio, and it borrows some of its code, but it is not a
modified rio.

The first milestone was to reach something like feature parity with rio.
The goals were:

- use lib9p instead of implementing the 9p server from scratch
	-> 9p no longer in separate proc, easier synchronization
- de-couple text handling from windows
	-> text.c
- cleaner code, make it more hackable


After that had been more or less achieved some new features were implemented:

- window decorations including title bars
	- various styles:
	  - flat style (extremely minimal)
	  - simple style (TODO: maybe rename this...)
	  - windows 3.x
	  - windows 95/nt4
	- '(no)title', '(no)border' wctl messages
- support for different color schemes
	- uses named devdraw images
- virtual desktops
	- 1-2 chord on desktop opens screen menu
	- 'screenoffset' wctl message
	- '(no)sticky' wctl message
- select window with mouse by reading from `pick' file
- tabbed windows (WIP)
	- new tab: click window instead of dragging out rectangle
	- close tab: button 2 on tab
	- move tab: 1-2 and 1-3 chords
	- move tab across window: button 3 on tab or title bar,
		click new window or background
	- 'newtab' wctl message
	- 'new -id n' attach name
- misc
	- 1-3 chord on desktop opens secondary menu

# Building

The window decoration style is set by linking in the relevant file,
so edit the `mkfile' to try different styles.
The options are: flat.c, simple.c, win3.c, win95.c
